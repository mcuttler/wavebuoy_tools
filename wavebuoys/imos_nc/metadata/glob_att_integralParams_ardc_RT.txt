abstract = UWA wave data collected from a range of sites along Western Australia by a combination of Sofar Spotter and Datawell Mark IV wave buoys.
acknowledgement = Any users of IMOS data are required to clearly acknowledge the source of the material in the format: "Data was sourced from Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) - IMOS is enabled by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)". This wave data was collected and quality controlled by the University of Western Australia. This dataset is an output from the Catching Oz Waves  project, which received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP748) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).
